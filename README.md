# Block-Chain
I've always been interested in blockchain technology and the potential that it has as a secure, anonymous ledger. This technology has had a large impact on the world of tech and will continue to revolutionize the way we process and look at transactions. 

My opinion has always been that the best way to learn a new technology is to make and implement it yourself, so I figured I would use python to develop a functional blockchain.
